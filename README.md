The objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive data analysis and visualization solution for the supermarket, enabling 
stakeholders to gain valuable insights into various aspects of the business. The Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for
decision-making, identifying trends, optimizing inventory, improving customer experience, and ultimately driving business growth.

Here is a summary of the project:

   a) Data Extraction and Transformation: The project begins with extracting sales data from the supermarket's databases or other
   relevant sources. The data is then transformed and cleaned using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency.

   b) Data Modeling: A robust data model is created using Power BI to establish relationships between different data tables. 
   This step involves defining primary and foreign keys, creating calculated columns, and organizing the data structure.

   c) Data Visualization: Power BI's powerful visualization capabilities are leveraged to create interactive and visually appealing
   reports and dashboards. Various charts, graphs, and tables are used to present the data in a meaningful way.

  Key Metrics and Insights: The project focuses on identifying and analyzing key metrics relevant to the supermarket business, 
  such as sales revenue, product performance, customer segmentation, and profitability. Insights are derived from these metrics to
  support data-driven decision-making.

  Advanced Analytics: Advanced analytics techniques, such as forecasting and trend analysis, are applied to predict future sales,
  identify monthly patterns, or detect anomalies in the data. These techniques enhance the depth of analysis and provide actionable
  insights.
